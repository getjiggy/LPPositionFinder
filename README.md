# LPPositionFindder

I built this as a side project to keep me busy while job searching. the intent is to build an api that takes a wallet address and returns all current/historical LP positions. I am going to try to build out further than this to also include Profit/loss, and fees received as a part of the response, providing the user with a complete overview of their LP positions.

I am going to initially support on univ3 and univ2 forks. I may expand capabilities further in the future. 

I am also going to use this project as a way of branching into Rust. I plan to build several rust components using Neon, starting with basic modules and branching into replacing some of the other services written in TS.

Feel Free to fork or use this code in whatever way you want.
