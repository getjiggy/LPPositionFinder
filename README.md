#LPPositionFindder

I built this as a side project to keep me busy while job searching. the intent is to build an api that takes a wallet address and returns all current/historical LP positions. I am going to try to build out further than this to also include Profit/loss, and fees received as a part of the response, providing the user with a complete overview of their LP positions.
